# To-do list

- Decide on initial specification: top N breeds of cat
- Find promising target websites from which to scrape photos
  - Two options: different websites per cat (more scraping code) or try to use
    websites with multiple cat breed images natively (less scraping code)
- Learn to use Scrapy to accomplish labelled image scraping
- Delegate duties on writing each scraper
